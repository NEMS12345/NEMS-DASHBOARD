## Implementation Plan

### Pre-Launch Priority 1: Security
```typescript

import { rateLimit } from 'express-rate-limit'
import { mfaMiddleware } from './auth'

export const securityMiddleware = [
  // Rate limiting
  rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
    max: 100
  }),
  // MFA verification
  mfaMiddleware,
  // Additional security measures
]
```

### Pre-Launch Priority 2: ML Infrastructure
```typescript
// ML pipeline example
interface MLPipeline {
  trainModel(data: IndustryData): Promise<ModelResult>;
  validateAccuracy(model: TrainedModel): ValidationResult;
  deployModel(model: ValidatedModel): DeploymentResult;
  monitorPerformance(model: DeployedModel): PerformanceMetrics;
}
```

### Pre-Launch Priority 3: Testing
```typescript
// Integration test example
describe('ML Component Integration', () => {
  it('should process industry data correctly', async () => {
    const testData = await loadIndustryTestData()
    const result = await processIndustryData(testData)
    expect(result.accuracy).toBeGreaterThan(0.95)
    expect(result.predictions).toBeDefined()
  })
})
